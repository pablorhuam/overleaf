@article{Levy544,
	Abstract = {Recent theoretical proposals suggest that strain can be used to engineer graphene electronic states through the creation of a pseudo{\textendash}magnetic field. This effect is unique to graphene because of its massless Dirac fermion-like band structure and particular lattice symmetry (C3v). Here, we present experimental spectroscopic measurements by scanning tunneling microscopy of highly strained nanobubbles that form when graphene is grown on a platinum (111) surface. The nanobubbles exhibit Landau levels that form in the presence of strain-induced pseudo{\textendash}magnetic fields greater than 300 tesla. This demonstration of enormous pseudo{\textendash}magnetic fields opens the door to both the study of charge carriers in previously inaccessible high magnetic field regimes and deliberate mechanical control over electronic structure in graphene or so-called {\textquotedblleft}strain engineering.{\textquotedblright}},

@article{Gorbachev448,
	Abstract = {Graphene has two distinct valleys in its electronic structure, in which the electrons have the same energy. Theorists have predicted that creating an asymmetry between the two valleys will coax graphene into exhibiting the so-called valley Hall effect (VHE). In this effect, electrons from the two valleys move across the sample in opposite directions when the experimenters run current along the sample. Gorbachev et al. achieved this asymmetry by aligning graphene with an underlying layer of hexagonalboron nitride (hBN) (see the Perspective by Lundeberg and Folk). The authors measured the transport characteristics of the sample, which were consistent with the theoretical predictions for the VHE. The method may in the future lead to information processing using graphene{\textquoteright}s valleys.Science, this issue p. 448; see also p. 422 Topological materials may exhibit Hall-like currents flowing transversely to the applied electric field even in the absence of a magnetic field. In graphene superlattices, which have broken inversion symmetry, topological currents originating from graphene{\textquoteright}s two valleys are predicted to flow in opposite directions and combine to produce long-range charge neutral flow. We observed this effect as a nonlocal voltage at zero magnetic field in a narrow energy range near Dirac points at distances as large as several micrometers away from the nominal current path. Locally, topological currents are comparable in strength with the applied current, indicating large valley-Hall angles. The long-range character of topological currents and their transistor-like control by means of gate voltage can be exploited for information processing based on valley degrees of freedom.},
